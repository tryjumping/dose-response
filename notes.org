* Track the continuous High                                            :idea:

* The player can start surrounded by hunger monsters and dead           :bug:
* The player can start within an irresistible dose's reach              :bug:
* The Hunger no longer howls to attract nearby hungers                  :bug:
** I like that feature and it's disappearance is an omission
** If we do want to remove it, it should be after testing
* The screen sometimes scrolls earlier than it should                   :bug:
** I've noticed this with horizontal scrolls, but it may be vertical too?
* Carrying small doses in inventory should be possible earlier than the large ones :idea:
** Right now they're all only pickable at the highest Will
* When there's no dose in sight and you're withdrawn, point in a general direction :idea:
** But only when you have no doses and no food
** I.e. this is to stop you from being completely fucked
** Because right now in that state you just have to wander randomly and hope
* Show the anxiety counter in the UI :idea:
** This will make it clearer to figure out that you want to keep hunting the Wills
** We can start by showing will with a decimal counter
** Or a "next will" progress bar
* Distribute the doses based on a pattern                              :idea:
** First I thought just put them across some jagged lines the player can follow
** But how about doing a tree-like or better yet (since we're 2D) neuron-like structure?
** It would give some structure to the map, the centres would have interesting clusters
** And if the player ever figures it out, might be cool
* Need to keep moving while waiting on the victory counter           :design:
** Right now, the best strategy is to dance around a save spot, doing nothing
** We need to force the player to keep moving
** Some ideas:
*** Get the monsters into a frenzy and start attacking the player
*** Only count "sobriety points" when a new ground is explored
**** This is hard to discover so I'm not keen
*** Give the player a goal they can achieve only while sober
**** Say talking to a family NPC
**** Show an arrow to the NPC?
* Add a new type of dose with different effects :idea:
** it would show as a different letter
** with a different colour (red?)
** it's own tolerance
** different effect on consumption (not explosion)
*** how about shooting rays in cardinal / diagonal directions?
*** could be two versions of the "same type" just like normal/strong dose now
*** the rays would destroy everything in their path -- including walls
*** the characters would be `+` and `x` for cardinal and diagonal rays
* Add NPCs :idea:
** these could be "friends and family"
** they're seen as translucent ghosts you can't interact with when High
** but they can accompany you when sober
*** making monsters not attack you
*** going sober more slowly
*** pointing towards useful/interesting things/places?
* Items that could reduce the dose effect                              :idea:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Other ideas and dynamics that come to mind: antabus would contradict
alcohol, stims vs downers, psychedelics (and a bad trip, depending on
what you encounter while high, might lower your craving for a next
dose but hurt your peace of mind or other stats), add paranoia and
other stats, make the player's psychological and physiological
conditions more detailed and readable (feels like blundering in a
black box atm).
#+END_QUOTE
** don't need to think about this too hard for now
** just create an item called "antidose" (yep, antidote pun)
** read up on the stuff mentioned in the quote for inspiration
** but initially, just disable post-high withdrawal (and maybe switch to sober immediately)
** there are meds that ease withdrawal effects
*** so maybe you're still withdrawn, but the screen wouldn't go dark so much
*** and the fov would not reduce so much
*** and it'd take more time for you to die (or maybe you wouldn't die at all, just transition to sober)
* Spending a long time in the "normal" state can add Will :idea:
* Remove the `build` folder from the releases :bug:
** Takes up a lot of space and it's entirely unnecessary
* Adding a bad trip :idea:
** Small chance of that happening
** But would make things actually worse for the duration of the dose
** What would happen if you took another dose by then?
*** normal High but you risk overdosing yourself
* Victory condition: dose ascension :idea:
** from strike:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An alternate victory condition could be "Ascension". When you combine
all sorts of chemical fireworks flowing in your veins and brains just
the right way and don't die in the process, you'll unlock the secrets
of the mind and become a badass ghost! :o) Maybe there could be a
key/enabler/artifact or more steps and hints, depending on what theme
you wanna go with. Aliens might be interesting (like the mysterious
complex drug is secretly an alien tech, for instance). The game might
indicate how your body morphs funny and how you feel strange and "hear
voices" etc., pulling you in one direction or the other. I don't think
I can think of a third option. Except maybe if you wanted to take this
route and make the path to ascension more complex, add distractions
and false drugs that lure you astray and kill your brain cells, making
it more difficult or something. Perhaps dreamy entheogens versus hard
stims  or whatnot, I dunno. // do research to get inspiration, wiki
and psychonaut websites are gonna be a goldmine, I'd say :p

perhaps pick one really interesting (or invent a new hypothetical one)

* Longer-term developments of the addiction/state of mind            :design:
** like what can you do if you put off getting doses for long
** what happens when your tolerance builds up
** ideally, I'd like the gameplay to change substantially as you progress based on how you play
** also ideally with like different "gameplay curves" -- but all systems driven
* Get a small amount of "food effect" (SoM points when not high) on killing a Hunger :idea:
** Could encourage players to seek them out
** But it's obviously dangerous
** And it may cost you food if you overestimate (which fits fighting hunger)
* Ideas about the main scope / goals of the game :design:
Finding out food and collecting it is good. More items to collect? Maybe stuff
that changes the gameplay in some way? Like the items in spelunky.

We should have some endgoal. Thematically, I can only thinking of curing the
addiction, but that seems like something of an optional difficult goal (e.g.
Hell in Spelunky). And anyway, how are we going to deal with this? Some items to
find/pick up? I was thinking something like the 12 step program but that isn't
bullshit.

Maybe finding people and getting their forgiveness/acceptance? And/or more
generally: dealing with your past.

Maybe in terms of the non-curing way... I don't know. What does an addict want?
Read through the wiki and some real stories? Despite the Marla Daniels quote,
I'd like there to be a way to complete the game. Something that keeps you exploring.

Or let's make it a survival/exploration sim. That would put a lot of the game
into the worldgen (and systems) but it seems like it could fit this. Consider
e.g. removing almost all monsters from an area, see how it plays.

Anyway, let's start with making the world bigger then one screen without actually
changing anything else at the moment. And then play it for a while and see what happens.

* Random chance that explosion destroys a wall, too?
** I think this is superseded by the horizontal/diagonal ray doses
* Ghost-like NPC becoming corporeal :idea:
** When being High, the player would see these ghost NPCs moving through the world
** When being sober, they'd become more and more corporeal
** Could point the player towards interesting places/end-game conditions, etc.
* Depression only moves by 2 squares when following the player :idea:
** When idle, it would only have 1 action point
** This ties into a more general idea of idle monsters and more complex AI
* Monsters that can modify the environment :idea:
** unblock passages
** block passages
** teleport the player?
* Gameplay beyond the first screen
** We need a greater pressure for exploration and leaving the area.
*** In my current playthroughs I just never care enough to leave.
*** consider tweaking the intoxication gain and drop to create stronger pressure
** Add different worlds the player can go to when leaving the map
*** this could either be completely random
*** or there may be a fixed or semi-fixed sequence (e.g. 2 tree worlds, than two other worlds, then three different worlds, etc.)
*** Some notes on different world generation:
http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/31241/random-map-generation/31245#31245
** consider restricting the possible ways to leave the map
** Split a large map into sections generaded from the initial seed and their positions from center
*** My (probably fast) ad-hoc concoction:
#+BEGIN_SRC
fn position_based_seed(initial_seed: u32, x: i32, y: i32) -> u32 {
    let high = (x as u16) as u32;
    let low = (y as u16) as u32;
    let encoded_pos = high << 16 | low;
    initial_seed ^ encoded_pos
}
#+END_SRC
**** fast but produces low values for low inputs
*** Better: just feed the inputs through a hash
*** Maybe use the integer hash function by Thomas Wang
*** http://web.archive.org/web/20071223173210/http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm
* Limited map size that the player has to explore [map alternative]
** spanning multiple screens
** but not infinite
** we'd have some sort of goal to find/accomplish there
** that would simplify our entity handling and mapgen
** The screen would be a view into that map
*** still need to figure out how to move inbetween screens
* More effects on High :idea:
** monsters get weaker (Dempression moving by one step per turn)
** dynamic / changing environment?
* Idle monsters select more distant destinations :idea:
** This should make it seem more realistic
** No longer just moving randomly back and forth
* improve level generator not to create blocked entities
** Actually, with the wall-destroying ray-based doses, we can just keep it in
** The player would look for means of destroying the wall if it had food/dose/anxiety in
* Don't allow suicide (if there's a way to avoid it) :ui:
** e.g. fatfingering the arrow when the Depression is near
* save & exit/load game :ui:

* Smooth-out animations for the fade-out when growing Withdrawn :ui:
** right now, they are discrete: from fade 50 to 45 in one frame
** better make it a fade animation of say 50ms or so
* Change the rate of the `High` animation based on intoxication :ui:
** (very high: fast-paced, should slow down on the way to sobriety)
* Better effects on player's death :ui:
** Fade out to red/black completely
** Uncover the entire map (with a reverse fade)
*** with full colours
*** showing player's corpse
* Make the graphics on Overdose death glitchy :ui:
* Better radious / FoV calculation :idea:
Instead of looking at the points' coordinates, look at the actual (pixel) space
each tile represents. The tiles are not points but squares with an area. This
should provide a visually better result (but will be harder to compute).
* Pick a good colour palette :ui:

Before the new World order, all the monsters were held in a single Vec
that was separate from the level, but the Level had a map of Position
-> Monster ID.

That way, we could mutably iterate over the monsters for their AI
routines while being able to look at the surrounding area including
monsters that would block movement/pathfinding, etc.

Right now, the monsters are stored within each World Chunk though.

That means to iterate over the monsters, we need to borrow the whole
World mutably, which precludes looking at the level or surrounding
chunks.

Requirement:

1. A monster sees the player nearby in another chunk
2. It finds a path (not trampling over other monsters) towards the player
3. It walks the path step by step
4. It hits the player
5. After the attack, it disappears


Rough code outline:

For each monster visible area + 10 tiles:
    - run monster AI:
      - check distance to player
      - howl
      - find path towards the player
    - do the action AI decided (walk, attack, wait)
      (needs to happen before we process the next monster)
      (may involve moving to another chunk)

- We want to chunkify the monsters and items and everything else, too


let monster_positions = world.monster_positions_within_area(left_top - 10, bottom_right + 10).collect();
for pos in monster_positions {
    let (ai, action) = {
        let monster = world.monster_on_pos(pos).clone();  // NOTE: this frees the world borrow
        monster.act(player_pos, world, rng)  // NOTE: this is read-only action so the clone is all right
    };

    // TODO: assign the AI state here!
    // TODO: process the action here!
}


Potential solutions:

1. Iterate internally, process monsters with a callback

We do this for the rendering currently.

2. Process monsters immutably, return a list of actions to be performed later.

This is the general idea in gamedev, but would the fact that the world
needs to be mutable interfere here?

Also, one monster's movement can block another one following it. So we
should probably process the monsters one by one.

3. Analogous to what we do now: keep monsters separately, update the
   world when their position changes

This will require making the Monsters vector availeble to World for
writing or for the chunks to be created explicitly (so we can add the
newly-generated monsters to the main Vec).

**** Could be pathfinding, too but I don't remember it being a problem before the chunks
*** Actually, it looks like it's just the depression moving there and back
*** And we see it because the visibility limit can be greater
*** So really, the monsters should all just set a more distant target and follow it
*** Instead of moving randomly
