pub const OVERVIEW: &str = "Dose Response is a roguelike: every time you start a game, the map will be different. The items and monsters will be in new places. And when you lose, that's it -- you can't reload and try again. You start from the beginning, with a brand new map. Every life matters.

You can't learn the map (because it changes), but you can learn the world. How do the monsters work? What happens when you take two doses at the same time? What's that glowing thing around a dose? What is food good for?

You will lose quickly and often. That's normal. Learn from it! What went wrong? Is there anything you could have done better? Were you saving an item for later that could have helped you?

Each run takes 3 - 10 minutes so you won't lose that much anyway. Experiment!";

pub const CONTROLS_HEADER: &str = "You control the @ character. It moves just like the king in Chess: one step in any direction. That means up, down, left, right, but also diagonally.
";

pub const CONTROLS_FOOTER: &str = "Using items: you can use an item you're carrying (food and later on, doses) by clicking on it in the sidebar or pressing its number on the keyboard (not numpad -- that's for movement).";

Imagine your @ is in the middle (where [5] is) and you just pick a direction.";

pub const ARROW_TEXT: &str = r"Arrow keys:

         \  |  /

Move in all eight directions using the left thumb stick. You point the stick in the direction you want to move to and then press the A (Xbox-like controllers) or X (on the PlayStation-like controllers) button to actually move.

To use an item, press B (or Circle) to open the inventory menu, navigate to the item and press A (or X) again.

Navigating menus: you can use the D-pad as well as the left thumb stick.
";

pub const HOW_TO_PLAY: &str = r#"Your character is an addict. Stay long without using a Dose, and the game is over. Eat Food to remain sober for longer. Using a Dose or eating Food will also defeat nearby enemies.

If you step into the glow around a Dose, you can't resist even if it means Overdosing yourself. At the beginning, you will also Overdose by using a Dose when you're still High or using a Dose that's too strong. By using Doses you build up tolerance. You'll need stronger Doses later on.

Each enemy has their own way of harming you. The Depression moves twice as fast. The Anxiety will reduce your Will on each hit. When it reaches zero, you will lose.

You attack enemies by bumping into them. Just move into the monster's tile and your character will attack it.

To progress, your Will needs to get stronger. Defeat enough Anxieties to make it go up. The Dose or Food "explosions" don't count though! Higher Will shrinks the irresistible area around Doses. It also lets you pick them up!

If you see another player characters, they are friendly. They will give you a bonus and follow you around, but only while you're Sober. You can have only one bonus active at a time."#;

pub const LEGEND: &str = "Monsters:
Anxiety: takes Will away when it hits you. Defeat them to win the game.
Depression: moves twice as fast. You lose immediately when it hits you.
Hunger: summons other Hungers nearby. Reduces your mind state.
Hearing Voices: paralyzes you for three turns.
Seeing Shadows: makes you move randomly for three turns.

NPC: ignores you when High. Talk to them Sober for a bonus.

Items:
Food: prolongs being Sober or in a Withdrawal. Kills monsters around you.
Dose: makes you High. When you're High already, you'll likely Overdose.
Cardinal Dose: Destroys trees in the horizontal and vertical lines.
Diagonal Dose: Destroys trees in the diagonal lines.
Strong Dose: very strong Dose. Don't use it by accident.

Each Dose has a faint glow around it. If you step into it, you will not be able to resist.

When the glow disappears completely, you can pick the dose up and use it later. Don't lose Will if you're carrying doses though!";
