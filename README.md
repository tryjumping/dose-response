Dose Response
=============


A roguelike game where you play an addict. It's far from finished and
you probably don't want to look at the code.


Headless / Remote-controlled Mode
---------------------------------

Dose Response can be controlled remotely via ZeroMQ. This is mostly
for testing and it's disabled by default.

To compile it in you need to have zeromq-devel (or equivalent) installed.

Build it with:

    cargo build --features=remote

And then pass `--remote` to the `dose-response` executable.
