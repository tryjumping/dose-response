* Game balance notes:
** DONE starting doses overlap
CLOSED: [2018-02-04 Sun 16:33]
** Immediatelly within starting doses' area
** DONE food can spawn at the player's location
CLOSED: [2018-02-04 Sun 16:33]
** DONE too many NPCs
CLOSED: [2018-02-04 Sun 17:48]
** Is the tolerance progression okay?
*** I have a feeling it builds up too slowly
*** But we definitely need to play some more and actually get to the endgame
*** Yea, I just won the game and I never had to use any of the strong stuff
*** Need to increase it
**** Did that, is it okay now?
* Balance the late game
** So I think the early to mid game is good
*** Until you start being able to collect doses
*** Tried to increase it too much and it didn't quite work out
**** The smallest doses were actually okay
**** But the larger ones weren't
**** Maybe increase their strength?
* Render the areas being scrolled to
** right now when scrolling, the new area is dark
** and it only gets filled in when the scrolling ends
* Implement proper fullscreen in SDL
** We can switch to fullscreen but it's not stretching the game
* Keep the control hints on for longer                                   :ui:
** Now that we've made the map smaller they disappear after the first move
** Let's make them stick at least for a while longer
* Move metrics into the engine
** We have a more granular control there
** We can see exactly how long teh full update took vs drawcall processing vs. sdl
* Consider using a fixed-step game loop?
** A bunch of people on r/roguelikedev seem to do that
** Does that mean we have to decouple game update and render?
*** and call them separately from the engine?
* Publish SDL-based binaries
** For linux, windows and mac
** Generated by the CI
* Figure out the occasional flicker on worklaptop
* Record a let's play
** would be nice to show the game in action
** people can watch it and see whether it's interesting for them
** Steps:
cargo run --release
xwininfo  # find the Window ID
recordmydesktop --windowid <window id>
record
Ctrl-c
* Create an itch.io page
- [ ] Game description
- [ ] Colour scheme
- [ ] Font
- [ ] Lets play/trailer
- [ ] Cover image
- [ ] Icon/Logo for Try Jumping
- [ ] Icon/Logo for Dose Response
- [ ] Builds
- [ ] Link to the online version
* Consider uploading binaries to AWS or something
** Instead of having them on github
** Should make nightlies easier, too maybe?
* Create "organisation" github & gitlab pages
** Set up redirects
** Fix links on my blog
* Set up an org email address
** info@example.com
* Create a tryjumping.com page
** Use a Rust or Go-based static site generator
** https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
** http://cobalt-org.github.io/getting-started/
* Add the code & contact info into the readme
** Link to the website
** Link to the repo
** Email address
* Look into trying the rust-sdl2's "bundled" feature
** Seems to be broken on Fedora 27 + Wayland
*** The bundled build just doesn't work
*** But the steamrt one (version 2.4 only; 2.6 is broken) does
*** Go to: http://repo.steamstatic.com/steamrt/pool/main/libs/libsdl2/
**** Download 'libsdl2_2.0.4+steamrt2+srt1_amd64.deb'
**** http://repo.steamstatic.com/steamrt/pool/main/libs/libsdl2/libsdl2_2.0.4+steamrt2+srt1_amd64.deb
*** Put it in a 'lib' directory
*** cp lib/libSDL2-2.0.so.0.4.0 lib/libSDL2-2.0.so.1
*** run code with: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib target/release/binary
*** Actually now I'm getting the examples build staticaly??
**** We need to create a SDL project and test this properly
** https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#bundled-feature
** It seems to build SDL2 as needed
** Maybe that can be almost as easy as using a pure rust solution?
*** Build dependencies:
**** cmake openssl-devel
*** We'll still need to handle runtime linking though (sigh)
**** RPATH in the release?
*** Test the controller examples
*** Test windows examples
*** Test ttf and image examples
**** require the "ttf" and "image" features
*** Check the drawing API
**** can we just use this?
**** could we use the TTF feature for fonts directly?
**** should be interesting as an optional backend
*** Pros:
**** Nice & robust drawing API?
**** Nice & robust font rendering API?
**** Joystick and gamepad support!
**** More robust keyboard support (afaict so far)
*** Cons:
**** Harder setup for coders (no longer just git clone && cargo run)
***** Maybe we could keep glium as the default feature
***** And use SDL for the shipped releases?
**** Extra deployment steps to ship the SDL libraries and link them
**** An entirely new set of bugs and missing features?
***** I mean it should be robust but idk
* Fullscreen crashes on Windows                                          :ui:

** https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver/commit/4705ff8a2baaa9d69b74dcef5f8b4186d920d6dc
** It seems to be working maybe?
** It's not running any of the dangerous calls afaics
** Give it a go
* Write a "call for artists" post?
** Here's what I'd like to see (in this order)
*** Icon
*** Colours
*** Font
*** Tiles
** Should post a demo
** Would prefer open formats
*** To keep with the open source spirit of the game
*** Something like CC-BY-SA sounds good
*** Must be available for commercial use (or at least licensed as such for me)
*** Expect zero profit but open to revenue sharing
** Post to:
*** website
*** twitter
*** g+
*** mastodon
*** maybe reddit?
* Select the final font / fonts                                          :ui:
** http://programmingfonts.org/list
** FYI Hero Trap uses "Dejavu Sans, monospace" and it looks pretty neat
* Add an icon to the generated executable on Windows
** window execs can have an icon embedded
** http://stackoverflow.com/questions/708238/how-do-i-add-an-icon-to-a-mingw-gcc-compiled-executable
* Make the game less dark
** It is actually really hard to see what's going on in withdrawal
** Ease off on the darkness fade somewhat
* Build nightlies
** Or have a way to build windows on my machine
*** Using wine
*** Or a VM
*** or cross-compile
* Consider using proper logging with in-game debug console             :code:
** The "no console" option for mingw seems to disable println entirely
** Even when we run the game from the console
** So: we should log to a file or some internal structure and print it out
* Show the current game build version in the main menu                   :ui:
** https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html
* Investigate terminal backend
** Libraries:
*** https://crates.io/crates/termion
*** https://crates.io/crates/rustbox
*** https://crates.io/crates/easycurses
*** https://crates.io/crates/crossterm
** Should be cross-platform
** Ideally no C deps (though I could live with that tbh)
* Use rect::Rectangle for Point::areas                                 :code:
* Split out the rendering functionality into a proper crate            :code:
** Call it "Charmed, I'm sure."
** Crates.io will be called "charmed"
* Add console printing to the wasm module
* Print out warnings if the js drawcalls and buffer capacities are exceeded
* Performance-tune the game
** minimise drawcalls and data transmission
** try to make sure we never have to grow our vectors
* NPCs should ignore monsters and destroy them when stepping on one    :idea:
** So this would make NPCs more like not even aware there are any monsters here
** But only when they are accompanying the player
* Pre-allocate the wasm drawcalls vecs better                          :code:
* Make the canvas drawing more performant                              :code:
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Optimizing_canvas
** Think about reducing the Draw::Rectangle and Draw::Fade data footprint
*** by like emulating an enum or something
* Consider uploading "nightlies" somewhere
** We run CI on every push, let's copy the binaries somewhere
** So we can always get the latest build out to folks
** Theoretically, this could be super easy with wasm
* Make it more obvious when the player would overdose :design:ui:
** https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/686dey/sharing_saturday_152/dgwl1go/
** see alphabetr's comment in that thread
** we could show the likelihood that a dose would result in overdose
** should add it to the how-to-play readme (and on the website)
** mention it in the let's play
** there's already an association between the white colour and overdose
*** let's use it
*** say when you stand next to a dose, it will blink between it's colour and white
*** and the rate of blinking will identify the likelihood that the dose will kill you
* Consider replacing Action Points with energy-based approach          :code:
** Basically, we'll want to be able to have NPCs move more slowly than the player
** So we need a speed system
** One such is described here:
*** http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/07/15/a-turn-based-game-loop/
** It's not necessarily about AP/Energy-based
*** we just need a way to be able to "build" some action up across turns
*** but it does kind of seem to me that maybe AP is not the right mental model here
*** because you don't generally store up APs (with a few exceptions)
** One place to use this would be: friendly NPCs more half as slow to be more approachable
*** Right now we just stop them when they're nearby
*** But it would be more lively/dynamic if they still moved just more slowly
* Have Anxieties be able to destroy the terrain                        :idea:
** I'd love to have a monster that does that
** And Anxiety is already red (the colour of the shattering explosion)
** Breaking a wall should take one turn so it's twice as slow as empty terrain
** And then we'd just give the same ability to the player with the "pickaxe"
* Special "gun" equipment                                              :idea:
** changes the movement behaviour:
When there is a monster in the direction of the movement (within 4
tiles), shoot a ray that kills all monsters in its path instead of
moving in that direction.
** infinite "ammo"
** can't be unequipped/dropped
** relatively rare (think jetpack in spelunky)
** takes 1 action point
* Special "pickaxe" equipment                                          :idea:
** can't be unequipped/dropped
** bumping into a solid/blocking tile (i.e. "tree") destroys it
** takes 1 action point
* Make the NPCs "angry" when you "hit" them                            :idea:
** Right now, nothing happens when you bump into them
** So instead, let's make them faded like when you get High for a few turns
* Irresistible doses don't always atract                           :bug:idea:
** Seems that when there is a normal dose in the irresistible area we can break free
** I'll need to test the exact parameters of this
** But maybe we'll want to keep it there as an "easter egg rule"?
* Rework the animation system                                          :code:
** Right now it's a bunch of boxed traits and we have to match on dose type
** It would be easier if we could just specify the type of animation to the dose and have a function produce the right struct
** We could also support multiple animations, which would let us compose a cross animation by:
*** square explosion of 1 diagonal area + 2 (or 4) horizontal animation lines
* The screen sometimes scrolls earlier than it should                   :bug:
** I've noticed this with horizontal scrolls, but it may be vertical too?
* Need to keep moving while waiting on the victory counter           :design:
** Right now, the best strategy is to dance around a save spot, doing nothing
** We need to force the player to keep moving
** Some ideas:
*** Get the monsters into a frenzy and start attacking the player
*** Only count "sobriety points" when a new ground is explored
**** This is hard to discover so I'm not keen
*** Give the player a goal they can achieve only while sober
**** Say talking to a family NPC
**** Show an arrow to the NPC?
* Change the High colours/effect
** Using the same colour as the doses makes them easy to miss
** Consider adding some orange or whatnot instead
** some inspiration: http://www.printmag.com/design-inspiration/acid-aesthetic-history-of-psychedelic-design/
* Show the anxiety counter in the UI                                :ui:idea:
** this will make it clearer to figure out that you want to keep hunting the Wills
** We can start by showing will with a decimal counter
** Or a "next will" progress bar
* Investigate adding sound to the game                                 :code:
** Not sure about ambient music, but sound effects might be neat
** We can look at rodio
*** https://crates.io/crates/rodio
* When there's no dose in sight and you're withdrawn, point in a general direction :idea:
** But only when you have no doses and no food
** I.e. this is to stop you from being completely fucked
** Because right now in that state you just have to wander randomly and hope
* Distribute the doses based on a pattern                       :mapgen:idea:
** First I thought just put them across some jagged lines the player can follow
** But how about doing a tree-like or better yet (since we're 2D) neuron-like structure?
** It would give some structure to the map, the centres would have interesting clusters
** And if the player ever figures it out, might be cool
* Items that could reduce the dose effect                              :idea:
** from strike:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Other ideas and dynamics that come to mind: antabus would contradict
alcohol, stims vs downers, psychedelics (and a bad trip, depending on
what you encounter while high, might lower your craving for a next
dose but hurt your peace of mind or other stats), add paranoia and
other stats, make the player's psychological and physiological
conditions more detailed and readable (feels like blundering in a
black box atm).
#+END_QUOTE
** don't need to think about this too hard for now
** just create an item called "antidose" (yep, antidote pun)
** read up on the stuff mentioned in the quote for inspiration
** but initially, just disable post-high withdrawal (and maybe switch to sober immediately)
** there are meds that ease withdrawal effects
*** so maybe you're still withdrawn, but the screen wouldn't go dark so much
*** and the fov would not reduce so much
*** and it'd take more time for you to die (or maybe you wouldn't die at all, just transition to sober)
* Spending a long time in the "normal" state can add Will :idea:
* Adding a bad trip                                                    :idea:
** Small chance of that happening
** But would make things actually worse for the duration of the dose
** What would happen if you took another dose by then?
*** normal High but you risk overdosing yourself
* Victory condition: dose ascension                                    :idea:
** from strike:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An alternate victory condition could be "Ascension". When you combine
all sorts of chemical fireworks flowing in your veins and brains just
the right way and don't die in the process, you'll unlock the secrets
of the mind and become a badass ghost! :o) Maybe there could be a
key/enabler/artifact or more steps and hints, depending on what theme
you wanna go with. Aliens might be interesting (like the mysterious
complex drug is secretly an alien tech, for instance). The game might
indicate how your body morphs funny and how you feel strange and "hear
voices" etc., pulling you in one direction or the other. I don't think
I can think of a third option. Except maybe if you wanted to take this
route and make the path to ascension more complex, add distractions
and false drugs that lure you astray and kill your brain cells, making
it more difficult or something. Perhaps dreamy entheogens versus hard
stims  or whatnot, I dunno. // do research to get inspiration, wiki
and psychonaut websites are gonna be a goldmine, I'd say :p
#+END_QUOTE
** That's basically fantasy land so I'm not sure how I feel about this
*** I kind of like the idea because it provides an addict victory condition
*** Doesn't necessarily be a fantasy (consider the "golden shot" or whatever it's called)
*** Train your will enough so you can collect doses and then down like a 100 at a same time?
* Victory condition: stable addict                                     :idea:
** Train yourself enough to be able to carry doses around
** Explore the world?
** Maybe find something that you wouldn't be able to otherwise
** "I've stopped smoking but I have a cigarette once a year"
* Make the doses more interesting                                    :design:
** Right now they're kind of bland: just increase SoM
** from strike:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
perhaps pick one really interesting (or invent a new hypothetical one)
that has useable body and mind feedback for gameplay - sky's the
limit. But a generic "something you're addicted to" is too 'meh' for a
game. Some backstory would add a lot to the experience, too.
#+END_QUOTE
* Mouse support                                                        :idea:
** Click on an inventory item to use it
** Click on a path to step one way towards it?
* Consider using just the cardinal movement                            :idea:
** Diagonals are hard on the beginners
** Maybe a mouse?
* Add a tutorial or something                                          :idea:
** Either a help doc or a tutorial or something to help the beginners
* Medication or sobriety badges                                        :idea:
** Instead of the 12-step bullshit
** You could come visit these centres
*** they'd feed you and somehow help you to combat the addiction
*** you could get sobriety bonuses (e.g. will increase, etc.)
* Effects for gaining/losing will                                        :ui:
** graphics (render it as a bar)
** consider displaying the partial will
*** say you have `Will = 5` but you've also killed three Anxieties, so your Will is more like `5.3`
*** maybe display the equivalent of the `.3` portion as a lighter bit on the Will progress bar
*** and as it gets closer to `1.0` its colour would get closer and closer to the "real Will colour"
** sound
* Longer-term developments of the addiction/state of mind            :design:
** like what can you do if you put off getting doses for long
** what happens when your tolerance builds up
** ideally, I'd like the gameplay to change substantially as you progress based on how you play
** also ideally with like different "gameplay curves" -- but all systems driven
* Get a small amount of "food effect" (SoM points when not high) on killing a Hunger :idea:
** Could encourage players to seek them out
** But it's obviously dangerous
** And it may cost you food if you overestimate (which fits fighting hunger)
* Ideas about the main scope / goals of the game                     :design:
Finding out food and collecting it is good. More items to collect? Maybe stuff
that changes the gameplay in some way? Like the items in spelunky.

We should have some endgoal. Thematically, I can only thinking of curing the
addiction, but that seems like something of an optional difficult goal (e.g.
Hell in Spelunky). And anyway, how are we going to deal with this? Some items to
find/pick up? I was thinking something like the 12 step program but that isn't
bullshit.

Maybe finding people and getting their forgiveness/acceptance? And/or more
generally: dealing with your past.

Maybe in terms of the non-curing way... I don't know. What does an addict want?
Read through the wiki and some real stories? Despite the Marla Daniels quote,
I'd like there to be a way to complete the game. Something that keeps you exploring.

Or let's make it a survival/exploration sim. That would put a lot of the game
into the worldgen (and systems) but it seems like it could fit this. Consider
e.g. removing almost all monsters from an area, see how it plays.

Anyway, let's start with making the world bigger then one screen without actually
changing anything else at the moment. And then play it for a while and see what happens.

* Depression only moves by 2 squares when following the player         :idea:
** When idle, it would only have 1 action point
** This ties into a more general idea of idle monsters and more complex AI
* Monsters that can modify the environment                             :idea:
** unblock passages
** block passages
** teleport the player?
* Gameplay beyond the first screen
** We need a greater pressure for exploration and leaving the area.
*** In my current playthroughs I just never care enough to leave.
*** consider tweaking the intoxication gain and drop to create stronger pressure
** Add different worlds the player can go to when leaving the map
*** this could either be completely random
*** or there may be a fixed or semi-fixed sequence (e.g. 2 tree worlds, than two other worlds, then three different worlds, etc.)
*** Some notes on different world generation:
http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/31241/random-map-generation/31245#31245
** consider restricting the possible ways to leave the map
** Split a large map into sections generaded from the initial seed and their positions from center
*** My (probably fast) ad-hoc concoction:
#+BEGIN_SRC

Before the new World order, all the monsters were held in a single Vec
that was separate from the level, but the Level had a map of Position
-> Monster ID.

That way, we could mutably iterate over the monsters for their AI
routines while being able to look at the surrounding area including
monsters that would block movement/pathfinding, etc.

Right now, the monsters are stored within each World Chunk though.

That means to iterate over the monsters, we need to borrow the whole
World mutably, which precludes looking at the level or surrounding
chunks.

Requirement:

1. A monster sees the player nearby in another chunk
2. It finds a path (not trampling over other monsters) towards the player
3. It walks the path step by step
4. It hits the player
5. After the attack, it disappears


Rough code outline:

For each monster visible area + 10 tiles:
    - run monster AI:
      - check distance to player
      - howl
      - find path towards the player
    - do the action AI decided (walk, attack, wait)
      (needs to happen before we process the next monster)
      (may involve moving to another chunk)

- We want to chunkify the monsters and items and everything else, too


let monster_positions = world.monster_positions_within_area(left_top - 10, bottom_right + 10).collect();
for pos in monster_positions {
    let (ai, action) = {
        let monster = world.monster_on_pos(pos).clone();  // NOTE: this frees the world borrow
        monster.act(player_pos, world, rng)  // NOTE: this is read-only action so the clone is all right
    };

    // TODO: assign the AI state here!
    // TODO: process the action here!
}


Potential solutions:

1. Iterate internally, process monsters with a callback

We do this for the rendering currently.

2. Process monsters immutably, return a list of actions to be performed later.

This is the general idea in gamedev, but would the fact that the world
needs to be mutable interfere here?

Also, one monster's movement can block another one following it. So we
should probably process the monsters one by one.

3. Analogous to what we do now: keep monsters separately, update the
   world when their position changes

This will require making the Monsters vector availeble to World for
writing or for the chunks to be created explicitly (so we can add the
newly-generated monsters to the main Vec).

counters.

This doesn't make that much sense and it means that the player is able

*** Always center the camera on the player?
**** I think this is worse because it's harder to see the monsters move
***** Because the entire map has moved
***** So there's no specific perceived motion
***** We'd have to probably move the monsters with an animation at a later frame
**** Could we try to just smooth-scroll the one tile transition?
***** That would require scrolling the map independently of the player though
****** Could we move the player and then re-center?
******* Would probably require smooth srolling
******* TODO Although maybe just making it two-step (move, recenter) is enough
****** Isn't that what Cardinal Quest does?
******* CQ processes everything at once and then animates it
******** The player moves
******** The monsters move
******** The screen recenters
******* All that is animated at the same time
******* There's no "player moves and then the monsters move"
***** Also, this would look weird for the diagonal movement
****** The player would actually be animated crossing walls
